 * This one is subject to a lot of opinion
 * Used as a tool for developers
 * The truth of the matter is that they can and do appear in client side parts of the app.
 * You may open the developer console of a website and see some console logs appear. 
 * There are some things you can do for a happy middle ground.
 * DO AVOID Leaving 'unprofessional console logs..'

/**Can I use comments in production code?
 * First, it is important that we ask ourselves what are we trying to achieve with a comment?
 * Use comments to explain intent not content
 * Good code should and will do its best to explain content
 * Sometimes there are business decisions that dictate why some content exists this is intent
