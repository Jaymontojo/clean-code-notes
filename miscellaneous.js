/**Can I use comments in production code?
 * First, it is important that we ask ourselves what are we trying to achieve with a comment?
 * Use comments to explain intent not content
 * Good code should and will do its best to explain content
 * Sometimes there are business decisions that dictate why some content exists this is intent
